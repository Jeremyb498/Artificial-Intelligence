In computer science, an ideal ‘intelligent’ machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. The term ‘artificial intelligence’ is applied when a machine mimics ‘cognitive’ functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ‘learning’ and ‘problem solving’.” -- Wikipedia “Artificial Intelligence”. Artificial intelligence has many uses in the modern world and most people probably don’t even realize that they use it. They don’t even realize how much it takes to create and program artificial intelligence. Since artificial intelligence is such a complex technology with many components it requires a lot of programming and effort to create. This report will investigate how the process of programming and creating an artificial intelligence and the types of artificial intelligences that are in use today affect society.")
